One thing I forgot to tell you. There's a routine in the FDL.C file for calculating the checksum over the code space. I wanted to talk with you about the best way to do that. For instance, are you planning on having some integrity check at power up and it could be done there. If the checksum failed then I thought we would only allow download (or something similar).
