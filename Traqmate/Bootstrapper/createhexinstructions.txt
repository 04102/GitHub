Use the Keil OH51 utility to create a hex file. Use the Keil hex2bin utility to create a binary image.

Syntax: HEX2BIN [/option] hexfile [binfile]

hexfile is the Intel HEX input file
binfile is the binary file to create

option  may be any of the following

  /Ln     Binary file length
  /Pn     Pad data for binary file
  /On     Address offset (to add to HEX records)
  /M      Merge data into existing BIN file
  /Q      Quiet mode (no statistics are displayed)
  /X      Don't process ext. segment/linear address records

This command line seems to work:
hex2bin /L0xFFFF /P0xFF hexfile binfile

Attached is the utility and a standalone SU binary image created with it. As an added bonus I have included a utility for calculating a checksum of the image. There is an app note on the Keil site showing how to calculate the checksum to ensure data integrity.
